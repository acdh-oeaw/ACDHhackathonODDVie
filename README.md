# ACDH virtual Open Data hackathon series 2019: Open Data Day Vienna hack
The repo containing your task for the second hackathon in the ACDH hackathon series 2019: Open Data Day Vienna hack. This task is open for submissions from Feb 11, 2019 (2 p.m. CET) to Feb 28, 2019 (midnight CET). 

## Your task

...will be announced here on Feb 11, 2019 at 2 p.m. CET.

## What your submission should contain

Each submission has to include code, an instruction on how to run it (readme), a short presentation of what was done (in a format of your choice: poster, video, description,...), enriched data (if applicable) and statistics on the data (if applicable).

## Judgement criteria

Your submission will be judged by the following criteria:
* Creativity, innovation  (e.g. Is the approach/idea new and unique? Does it do something that hasnâ€™t been done before? Does it provide new insights into the data? Does the hack provide a new/faster/clearer solution to the old problem?)
* Accessibility, reusability, reproducibility (e.g. Is the code properly documented? Is the technical approach reproducible?)
* Elegance (e.g. Is the code easy to modify and reuse? Is it readable for others? Is modularity considered in the design? Is the code simple and concise?)

## Openness

Participants will work on their solutions in a dedicated (own) GitHub repository. Once you have finished your work, set your repo to public, tag it #ACDHhackathonODDVie and send the repo link to vanessa.hannesschlaeger[at]oeaw.ac.at and tanja.wissik[at]oeaw.ac.at.

All code submitted by all participants (as well as all reviews by all judges) shall be made permanently publicly available on GitHub under an MIT license (respectively a fitting open license for submissions of enriched data and presentation material). By submitting their code to this challange, participants agree to these terms.
